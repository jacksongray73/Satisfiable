USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Ensure that "satisfiability.txt" is located within the same directory as the program. It may be used
with the pre-loaded boolean equations or the user may replace them with their own. Boolean equations
must follow the following formatting rules:
	1. Each equation may only be 1 line.
	2. Equations variables must consist of single letters.
	3. AND may be written as && or ⋀.
	4. OR may be written as || or ⋁.
	5. NOT may be written as ! or ¬.

When run, the program will automatically read the file and print the results to the terminal.
